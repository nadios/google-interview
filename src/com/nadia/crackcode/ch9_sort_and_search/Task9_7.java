/**
 * A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one
 * anotherâ€™s shoulders For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be both shorter
 * and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights and weights of each
 * person in the circus, write a method to compute the largest possible number of people in such a tower.
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input (ht, wt): (65, 100) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
 * Output:  The  longest  tower  is  length  6  and  includes  from  top  to  bottom:  (56,  90)
 * (60,95) (65,100) (68,110) (70,150) (75,190)
